## Project Introduction
A simple front-end resume generator that does not collect any of your data and does not make any backend requests. Therefore, all changes are saved in `localStorage`. You can experience it at the following website:

## Usage
Use the content and style editor to dynamically edit your resume, then click `Export PDF` button, and in the browser's pop-up window, choose `Save as PDF` to save it.

Remember to check `Background graphics` so that the background color can be applied correctly.

## Acknowledgements
### Source of Idea
Originally, I wanted to write a resume for myself, so I searched for open-source resume generators on GitHub and found two that I found very useful.

1. [Visky/resume](https://github.com/visiky/resume)
2. [AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume](https://github.com/AmruthPillai/Reactive-Resume)

Both of these projects are very useful, and I think they can meet most needs. However, I found that when using the latter, the project description would compress the date text when it is too long, and when using the former, I wished for more customization options. So, I embarked on an endless journey of searching.

After going through

1. Needing registration/login
2. Needing to manually format and write pure MD
3. Needing manual formatting for template in docs format
4. ...

I decided to write one generator myself (lol)

Since I prefer a simple resume layout, this project doesn't have any complex formatting.

Yes, you can ask your friend to select `Export Resume` locally and send you the JSON file. Then you can select `Import Resume` to use it.

### 2. Where can I find more icons?
You can directly go to [Iconify Icons](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/) to search for icons, and then copy the corresponding code and use it.
